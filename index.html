I am blessed with two amazing parents; Anthony and Lynn, and two younger sisters, Mackenzie and Logan. My father is works for Far West Distributors and my mother works in real estate. My sister Mackenzie is a junior in high school and is involved in many different sports teams and club. Logan is the youngest of us three girls.

<h2>Free Time</h2>
<p>
		Whenever I have free time I love hanging with my friends. Out door activities really appeal to me. Tanning, swimming, being active, is what I enjoy most. If I have a lot of free time I love to travel. I want to go anywhere and everywhere, all over the world

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>
	Growing up I was forced to go to school. My fist school I Went to was Methodist church. This was where I attended preschool. My next school was where I spent 7 years. Kindergarten through 6 grade I went to Royal Oaks Elementary school. Once completing Elementary school I attended Green Acers Middle School for two years. Following middle school I went to Redwood high school. I spent four years at that school. Currently I am attending Fresno Pacific University. This is my second year here. Following this year I only I have two more to go then my education will be complete.
